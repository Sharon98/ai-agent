Code for learning how to create an AI agent using Google Gemini API
You will need your own key!

## WARNING 
This agent is empowered to read, edit, and create files.
It should only operate within the working directory you supply, but if that folder is your repo
or C:\... files can be destroyed. 

1. Enforce some guard rails or don't at your own peril.
2. Do not turn it loose on the network.
3. Make sure you have backup of your working directory. It does not file confirm changes before it makes them!
